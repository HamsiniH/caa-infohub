Legal advice if detained:

1) Do not sign anything
2) In case your phone / belongings are being taken away, demand a receipt.
3) Create videos/ record if you witness brutality or are being subjected to aggression. DO NOT put yourself in personal danger to do so. 
4) Do not escalate any situation with the police if you are detained. Legal help will come.
