Legal advice if detained:

1) Do not sign anything
2) In case your phone / belongings are being taken away, demand a receipt.
3) Create videos/ record if you witness brutality or are being subjected to aggression. DO NOT put yourself in personal danger to do so. 
4) Do not escalate any situation with the police if you are detained. Legal help will come.

# üò∑ Protest Advisories

What to take to a protest
- Lots of water in a plastic bottle, to drink 
- Energy snacks 
- A small medi-kit with bandages, plasters, tape etc. 
- Just enough money for pay-phone, food, transportation. 
- Watch, paper, pen for accurate documentation of events, police brutality, injuries. 
- Inhaler, epipen, insulin or other meds if applicable. 
- Several days of prescription medication and doctor's note in case of arrest. 
- Menstrual pads, if needed. Avoid using tampons - if you're arrested you may not have a chance to change it (tampons left in for more than six hours increase your risk of developing toxic shock syndrome) 
- Wet Wipes 


If you are hit by tear gas, remember the following (via Sarah Jeong):

- Do not rub it in! 
- Cover your nose and mouth with a damp cloth. Particulates will stick to it, instead of your mucus membranes.
- A solution of 50/50 liquid antacid & water (LAW) can be used to rinse eyes.
- Vinegar on cloth can help counteract tear gas. Vinegar is not necessary, and you can (and absolutely should) use the LAW for this purpose. Using the liquid antacid mixture also reduces the chance of accidentally pouring the wrong liquid into people‚Äôs eyes, in low-visibility conditions.
- Make sure to rinse off in a cold shower when you get home. Heat can reactivate residue.
- Store garments that have been exposed in a plastic bag until you can launder them to keep contaminants contained.
- Try to keep calm, and regulate your breathing. Keep an eye out for anyone having an asthma attack.
- Walk briskly, don't run. Running increases your rate of respiration, & also your chances of injury to self & others.
