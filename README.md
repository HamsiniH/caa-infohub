Legal advice if detained:

1) Do not sign anything
2) In case your phone / belongings are being taken away, demand a receipt.
3) Create videos/ record if you witness brutality or are being subjected to aggression. DO NOT put yourself in personal danger to do so. 
4) Do not escalate any situation with the police if you are detained. Legal help will come.

# 😷 Protest Advisories

If you are hit by tear gas, remember the following (via Sarah Jeong):

- Cover your nose and mouth with a damp cloth. Particulates will stick to it, instead of your mucus membranes.
- A solution of 50/50 liquid antacid & water (LAW) can be used to rinse eyes.
- Make sure to rinse off in a cold shower when you get home. Heat can reactivate residue.
- Store garments that have been exposed in a plastic bag until you can launder them to keep contaminants contained.
- Try to keep calm, and regulate your breathing. Keep an eye out for anyone having an asthma attack.
- Walk briskly, don't run. Running increases your rate of respiration, & also your chances of injury to self & others.
